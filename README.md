# Face-Mask-Detection
I developed a deep learning-based Face Mask Detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to address public safety concerns in high-risk environments such as hospitals, public transport, and retail spaces. The model was trained on a labeled dataset containing images of individuals with and without face masks, with preprocessing steps like resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve generalization. The CNN architecture was designed to extract spatial features from facial regions and accurately classify mask presence, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing masked versus unmasked individuals in various lighting and pose conditions.

As the sole developer, I handled the entire project lifecycle â€” from data acquisition and preprocessing to model training, tuning, and evaluation. I implemented dropout layers for regularization, applied data augmentation to reduce overfitting, and monitored training with validation accuracy and loss graphs. Additionally, I integrated the trained model into a Python-based interface for rapid testing, allowing real-time predictions on uploaded images. This solution demonstrates how AI can be leveraged for real-world health compliance monitoring and could be expanded into live surveillance systems or embedded edge devices with further optimization.
